# Web Scraping Project Readme

## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform web scraping on a selected website, extracting information related to GitHub topics and repositories. The primary focus is on gathering data such as topic titles, URLs, descriptions, repository names, usernames, stars, and repository URLs. The collected data will be stored in CSV format for further analysis.

### Step 2: Jupyter Notebook
Create a Jupyter notebook to outline the project strategy. Summarize the approach, and plan for scraping and storing the data.

### Step 3: Web Scraping
#### Substep 3.1: Identify URLs
- Inspect the HTML source of the website to identify the URLs containing the relevant information.
- Determine the structure of the pages to locate topics and repositories.

#### Substep 3.2: Use the `requests` Library

- Create a function to automate downloading for different topics or search queries.

### Step 4: Data Extraction
- Extract information from the downloaded web pages using appropriate parsing techniques.
- Collect topic titles, URLs, descriptions, repository names, usernames, stars, and repository URLs.



## Note
Always be respectful of website terms of service and policies while scraping. Ensure that your scraping activities comply with legal and ethical standards.
